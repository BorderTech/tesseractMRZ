### The dataset ###

The dataset contains more than __#7 thousands__ images (__.tif__) with ground truth (__.gt.txt__) from Google image augmented with few synthetic data.

The dataset is ready to be used to train with Tesseract v4.

### The models ###

If you're lazy and don't want to train the model by yourself then, try the ones under __tessdata_best__ (*float-model*) or __tessdata_fast__ (*int-model*) folders.

### Testing the accuracy ###
